Language Specification and Implementation
#########################################

This section describes how device models can be specified in the Device Modeling 
Language (DML) encoded in Scala (Device Modeling in Scala -- DMS). 
Note that because there are multiple ways to 
express the device models in Scala, the specification described here should not 
be treated as prescriptive. Instead, the specification is provided as a 
guideline for people that are not familiar with Scala (but familiar with Java) 
in order for the model to be accepted by the DMS Model Extractor; some 
possible variations are described on how one can express a model differently.
