How To Build MDCF using the Simple Build Tool (SBT)
===================================================

Requirement: 
* Java 7 SDK or above
* Ant

Let REPO denotes the path containing mdcf-build,
REPO_DML denotes the path containing mdcf-devicemodel projects,  
REPO_CORE denotes the path containing sireum-core projects 
(e.g., sireum-pilar), 
REPO_PRELUDE denotes the path containing sireum-core.prelude projects 
(e.g., mdcf-dml-ast).

To run the build locally, create the symbolic links:

REPO/mdcf-build/codebase/devicemodel

that points to REPO_DML, and

REPO/mdcf-build/codebase/sireum-core

that points to REPO_CORE, and

REPO/mdcf-build/codebase/sireum-core.prelude 

that points to REPO_PRELUDE.

Once that setup, change directory to:

REPO_INTERNAL/mdcf-build

To build and run test, run:
 
build.sh [<result-path>]

The default <result-path> is the current directory (".").

To resolve mdcf-build Eclipse project dependency, run tools/bin/sbt-init 
instead of tools/bin/sbt-init
