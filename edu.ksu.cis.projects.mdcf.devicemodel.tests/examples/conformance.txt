Note: all attributes in sub-features are flattened first,
thus, a set of features only consists of just attributes. 

features F1 conforms to features F2 iff
  forall attr in F2.
    exists attr' in F1.
        modifier(attr') conforms modifier(attr)
      and
        name(attr') == name(attr)
      and
        type(attr') conforms type(attr)

Modifier conformance:
* const conforms to const
* val   conforms to val
* var   conforms to val
* var   conforms to var

Type conformance:
* forall t in Types.     t conforms to t
* forall t, t' in Types. t include t' ==> t conforms to t'
